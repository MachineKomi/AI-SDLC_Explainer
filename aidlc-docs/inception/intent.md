# Intent

The AI-SDLC Explainer is an interactive, local-first terminal application that teaches developers the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) methodology through structured lessons, quizzes, and reference material—enabling teams to understand and adopt the three-phase lifecycle (Inception, Construction, Operations), master the 10 core principles, and apply rituals like Mob Elaboration and Mob Construction, all grounded in authoritative AWS sources and practitioner best practices.
